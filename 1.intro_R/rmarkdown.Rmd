# What is RMarkdown?

RMarkdown is a tool within RStudio that allows you to write documents, presentations, or webpages that combine written text with analytical code.

- The text in the document can be fully formatted in a report style (e.g., with headers, bolded text, hyperlinks, etc.)
- You can choose to make your code visible or not
- Documents can be output as PDFs, Word Documents, HTML, and other formats

--

## Why use RMarkdown?

- Compile a single R Markdown document to a report in different formats, such as PDF, HTML, or Word.
- Create notebooks in which you can directly run code chunks interactively.
- Make slides for presentations (HTML5, LaTeX Beamer, or PowerPoint).
- Produce dashboards with flexible, interactive, and attractive layouts.
- Build interactive applications based on Shiny.
- Write journal articles.
- Author books of multiple chapters.
- Generate websites and blogs.

# Install and load

RMarkdown is a package like any other so:

```{r eval=F}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
library(rmarkdown)
```

--

To open a new document use RStudio, this way you'll get an example script to guide you:

# Document orientation

There are three basic components of an R Markdown document: the metadata (YALM), text (Markdown), and code (R).

---
# YALM

This is a minimal example of yalm options in an RMarkdown document. This will shape the outcome of your document.

```yalm
title: "Hello R Markdown"
author: "Awesome Me"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: html_document
```

You can even execute R code!

```yalm
title: "RMarkdown"
subtitle: "Show and reproduce with RMarkdown"
author: "Bea Hernández"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output: 
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]
    lib_dir: libs
    nature:
      highlightStyle: github
      highlightLines: true
      countIncrementalSlides: false
```

# Code chunks

A code chunk starts with three backticks like ```` ```{r} ```` where r indicates the language name, and ends with three backticks. You can write chunk options in the curly braces (e.g., set the figure height to 5 inches: ```` ```{r, fig.height=5} ````). The code is [not limited to R](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#language-engines).

```{r}
# This is an executable code chunk.

fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

--

There's a lot of options for your code chunks, you can take a look of all in the [RMarkdown Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown).

---
# Render your document

You can render your document directly on RStudio or from the console typing: 

rmarkdown::render('foo.Rmd', 'pdf_document')

--

Lastly, there's an *unofficial* way to compile Rmd documents: the function xaringan::inf_mr(), or equivalently, the RStudio addin “Infinite Moon Reader”. Obviously, this requires you to install the xaringan package, which is available on CRAN. The main advantage of this way is LiveReload.
