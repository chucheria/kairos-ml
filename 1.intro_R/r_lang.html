# What is R



---
class: middle

- R is **‘GNU S’** (free software under the GPL License)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
- R is **language and environment**
- R is for **statistical computing** and **graphics**

# Get Started

---

# Install R

1. Download from [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. Check your installation: in the terminal type `R`

```bash
$ R

R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"
Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.5.0 (64-bit)
```

--

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), but you do not have to. There are other IDEs:

- [Emacs](https://ess.r-project.org/)
- [PyCharm](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6632-r-language-support)

--

Or use the terminal:

--

```bash
$ Rscript my_script.R
```

# Add-ins

# add-in?

## What is an add-in?

- Written in R
- Lives in an R package
- Invoked by the user
- Can be interactive or non-interactive

## Examples

- See live changes in Xaringan
- Copy and paste data frames from external sources
- Choose a ggplot theme on the fly

# R basics

Let's do some basic R in the console!
---

# Basic math


```r
5+7
```

--

Store the result in a variable. The assignment operator `&lt;-` is read as `gets` or in Spanish as `asignar`. To view de content of the variable just type the variable:


```r
x &lt;- 5 + 7
x
```

---
# Numeric vectors

The easiest way to create a vector is with the `c()` function (*concatenate* or *combine*)

--


```r
c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
z &lt;- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
```

--

Do you have a question about any function? Just type `?function` in the console and the help will magically appear. Try it now:


```r
?c
```

--

We can combine vectors with the same function:


```r
c(1, z, 2)
```

--

And perform arithmetic expressions on vectors. Common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, `^`, `%%`.


```r
z * 2 + 100
```

When you do this R is a vector of 2: `c(2, 2, 2)`, and another one of 100.

---
# Numeric vectors and sequences

You can perform arithmetic operations between two vectors element by element.

```r
z / c(3, 2, 1)
```

--

And the same *reciclyng* principle happens with different length vectors:


```r
c(1,2,3,4) + 1:10
```

--

What about more complex sequences?


```r
pi:10
```

--

Again, you can get the documentation of `:` typing `?:` in the console. 

--

Try to use `seq()` and `rep()` to do different vectors:

- From 1 to 10 with length 30.
- From 1 to 10 incremented by 0.5.
- Make a 0 vector of length 10.

---
# Atomic vectors and lists

- An **atomic vector** contains exactly one data type.
- A **list** may contain multiple data types.

--

## Logical vectors

A logical vector can contain `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NA` (not available).

Let's create a logical vector based on conditions on a numerical vector.


```r
c(0.5, 55, -10, 6) -&gt; c
c &lt; 1
```

--

If we have two logical expressions A and B:

- Use `&amp;` and `|` in logical expressions involving the logical values TRUE and FALSE. 
- User `!` to negate.


```r
(3 &gt; 5) &amp; (4 == 4)
```

---
# Atomic vectors

## Character vectors

Character vectors work exactly the same as numeric vectors, and the `paste()` function treats every element as a character.


```r
LETTERS
paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
```

--

## Subseting

Let's create a random vector `x` with the function `runif`, with length 10, and positive and negative numbers. We can get the first 5 elements:


```r
x[1:5]
```

--

Get all elements different from `NA`, all the positives, the 3rd and 5th elements, and all elements except the 4th.

--


```r
x[!is.na(x)]
x[x &gt; 0]
```


---
# Lists

You can create named vectors and lists:


```r
vect &lt;- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)
```

You can print it to the console or only get its names with the function `names`.

With a named vector you can try another way of subsetting: get the `bar` element.

--

A list can be nested and have a lot of levels. Create the `l` and `m` lists:


```r
l &lt;- list(thing="hat")
m &lt;- list(el = "element", list = l)
```

--

If the variable lst contains a list, it can be indexed in two ways: `lst[[n]]` is the nth element of the list; whereas `lst[n]` is a list whose only element is the nth element of lst. 

---
# Functions

Let's start with a simple one:


```r
Sys.Date()
```

--

You can also create a function:


```r
remainder &lt;- function(num, divisor = 2) {
    num %% divisor
}
```

--

You want to see a function arguments? Use `args(remainder)` or the help!

# Data Structures

---
class: middle

- An array is a multidimensional vector. Vectors and arrays are stored the same way internally, but an array may be displayed differently and accessed differently.
- Data frame has column names and row names. Data frame let you treat some features as factor.

---
# Array and Matrix


```r
a &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
a
```

--


```r
w &lt;- array(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18),dim=c(3,3,2))
w[, , 1]
```

---
# Data Frames

R has some datasets which you can access to learn. We are going to explore `USArrests`, first a variable will get this data frame, and then we will ask for some help on this data:


```r
arrest &lt;- USArrests
```

--

Get some more information about this dataset with functions `class` and `dim`. If we are working with R we have to make sure we don't run out of RAM memory, so the `object.size` function is very handy.

There are more advanced techniques to work with more than RAM memory.

--

Display the first rows of data with `head` to take a look at the set. Finally to get a glimpse of the distribution you can use `summary`, and `str` to find out about structure of the columns.


```r
summary(arrest)
str(arrest)
```

---
# Packages and help

## Packages

We are going to be loading several packages through the course. There are two fundamental functions for packages:

- `install.packages`: to install a package
- `library`: to load a package

--

We are going to install `rmarkdown` and `tidyverse` for the next chapters.

--

## Halp!

We have already see a way to have access to the function help. There are also other ways, like looking for a package documentation or a tutorial:

- [CRAN Packages](https://cran.r-project.org/): packages documentation.
- Vignettes: tutorial to start using a package.
- Cheatsheets: all basic functions of a package.
- `?`: inmediate access to function help.
