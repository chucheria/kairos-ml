# Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines, known better as SVMs, are a machine learning model that use hyperplanes to separate data. To separate and partition our data, we find some kind of plane (or in the cases of two-dimensional data, a line) that separates them and use the vectors that maximize the separation in the data.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/smv.png')
```

# Support Vector Machines

SVMs work by employing something called the *kernel trick*: This is a method by which we can **transform** the data for which we are trying to draw a decision boundary, and then **apply a hyperplane** separation on that transformed data. In its simplest form, the kernel trick means transforming data into another dimension that has a clear dividing margin between classes of data.

In practice, this transformation is more or less a **black box** because the feature space can be quite complex, but the idea is still the same.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "60%"}
