Machine learning (ML) is: 

- The scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task **without** using explicit instructions.
- It is seen as a **subset** of artificial intelligence.<sup>1</sup>
- Deep Learning is a **subset** of ML based on Artificial Neural Networks.

# Types

## Types of ML 

- **Supervised learning**: the learning algorithm is presented with labelled example inputs, where the labels indicate the desired output. SML itself is composed of **classification**, where the output is categorical, and **regression**, where the output is numerical.
- **Unsupervised learning**, no labels are provided, and the learning algorithm focuses solely on detecting structure in unlabelled input data.

Note that there are also *semi-supervised learning* approaches that use labelled data to inform unsupervised learning on the unlabelled data to identify and annotate new classes in the dataset.

## Types of problems

- **Regression**: our target variable takes continuous values.
- **Classification**: our target variable takes categorical values.

This will shape the way we sample our data, the algoritms we choose, and the error measurement.

# Classification on the iris data

We are going to do a little (more than tested) model to get to know what will come next. To do that we are going to use the `caret` package, so go ahead and install it. There's some kind of error installing `caret` in OSX, please visit [this question in SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25990296/how-to-include-omp-h-in-os-x/) to fix it.

--

The dataset will be the `iris` dataset stored in base R. The dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables *sepal length* and *width*, and *petal length* and *width*, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris: *Iris setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*.

```{r iris_summary, message=F}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
summary(iris)
```

# Train and test

We are going to split the data in *train* and *test*. With the *train* dataset we will *teach* our model for test it later on the unseen *test* dataset.

--

```{r split, message = F, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(42)
ind <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(iris), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.8, 0.2))
train <- iris[ind, ]
test <- iris[!ind, ]


ggplot(data = reshape2::melt(train), aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

```{r distribution, message=F, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data = train, aes(Species)) +
  geom_bar()
```

Looks like my train set has more of one *Specie* (target variable) than of others, the previous method will be useful in other cases (to reduce bias, for example), in this case we want to have more or less the same number of each *Specie* to have a nice prediction.

---

```{r resplit, message=F, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
index <- createDataPartition(iris$Species, p=0.20, list=FALSE)
train <- iris[index, ]
test <- iris[-index, ]

ggplot(data = train, aes(Species)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

Let's build our model, because we want to predict the specie given the other parameters, it is a classification problem.

We will see two metrics to evaluate the model:

- Accuracy: percentage of correctly classifies instances out of all instances.
- Kappa: like classification accuracy, except that it is normalized at the baseline of random chance on your dataset.

# Train

```{r train, message=F}
model_fit <- train(Species~., data = train, method = "knn", 
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = 1:25))
model_fit
```

---
# Predict

```{r predict, message=F}
predictions <- predict(model_fit, test)
confusionMatrix(predictions, test$Species)
```

# Training and testing

Machine learning requires us to first **train** a data model. We have data for which we want a prediction, so we pass it through the model and get a result out. Then, we evaluate the results and see the associated errors.

When building a predictive model, you need to go through **phases of validation** to ensure that you can trust its results. You need a way to see what the errors generated by the model will be so that you can **better tune** it appropriately.

*You want to predict the value for some stock price tomorrow for which it’s impossible to get the data, you could build a model that is trained on data from a few days ago and test it on data that you have from yesterday. Because you already have the answers for stock prices from yesterday, seeing what the model outputs and comparing the numbers can provide valuable feedback to see whether the model is working.*

We typically do a **70/30** split or **80/20** split (depending on the size of out dataset) of the data into the training/test subsets.

---
# Splitting the data

There are two major assumptions that we work with when doing these training/test splits:

- The data is a **fair** representation of the actual processes that you want to model.
- The processes that you want to model are **relatively stable** over time and that a model built with last month’s data should accurately reflect next month’s data.

## Roles of Training and Test Sets

When you split the data into a training and test set, it’s the training set that that you use for model training. The specific coefficients you get as a result of the modeling procedures are entirely based on the training dataset and don’t depend at all on the test data.

The role of the test set of data is to see how well that model stacks up against real data.

--

### Why Make a Test Set?

It is a solid way of validating that model. From a statistical standpoint, any model that gives you 100.0% accuracy should be cause for concern. You can use the test set to evaluate the predictive performance of the trees in the data to find the one with the lowest error.

---
# Resampling

Can I do the sampling again if I'm not happy with the model? **Of course**.

Doing feature selection is very important but choosing a *right sample* is too. One that is **unbiased**, that doesn't **overfit/underfit** our data, and that is **unvariance** is the *ideal* train set (almost never achiavable, we will see that in the *bias-variance tradeoff*).

# How do I measure my model?

---
# Regression

*RMSE - Root mean square error* and *MAE - Mean absolute error* are two different ways of look at the average difference between the model output and the values we have in our test set. 

*RRSE - Root relative squared error*, *RAE - Relative Absolute Error* we measure in percentage how mucho the feature deviates sfrom its average value. They are relative errors.

```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.align='center', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/rmse.png')
knitr::include_graphics('figs/mae.png')
knitr::include_graphics('figs/rrse.png')
knitr::include_graphics('figs/rae.png')
```


---
# Classification

We calculate the *confussion matrix*, in which the model output predicted classes are compared to the actual classes and the count of the model output in the cells of the matrix. This informs you of the *true positives*, *true negatives*, *false positives*, *false negatives*. This numbers allow us to get metrics on the model: 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/confussionmatrix.png')
```

- *Sensitivity or recall*: When it is actually the positive result, how often does it predict correctly?

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/sensitivity.png')
```

---
# Classification

- *Specificity*, When it is actually the negative result, how often does it predict correctly?

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/specifity.png')
```

- *Precision*: When it predicts the positive result, how often is it correct?

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/precision.png')
```

- *Accuracy*: How often is the classifier correct?

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/accuracy.png')
```

- *F1 Score*: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/f1.png')
```

# Cross-validation

---
# Cross-validation

The process of training and testing data is still somewhat limited, however. In one capacity, when you’re testing the model output against the reserved data, you are seeing only what the error is for that exact grouping of the test data.

**Cross-validation** is a statistical technique by which you take your entire dataset, split it into a number of small train/test chunks, evaluate the error for each chunk, and then average those final errors. This approach winds up being a more accurate way of assessing whether your modeling approach has any issues that could be hidden in various combinations of the training and test parts of the dataset.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = "40%", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/k-fold.png')
```

---
# k-fold Cross-validation

1. Take your dataset and split it into k chunks.
2. For each of these chunks:
  1. Split the data into a smaller train/test set.
  2. Evaluate that individual chunk’s error. 
3. After you have all the errors for all the chunks, take the average.
